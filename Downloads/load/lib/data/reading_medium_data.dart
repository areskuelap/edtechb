      "When people move to a new country, they should follow the customs of the new country rather than the customs of their home country.",
      "Some people believe that when visiting a foreign country, one should adhere to the practices and customs of that country. In my opinion, one should not blindly follow foreign or one's own customs. Instead, the best of both cultures should be adopted. When people visit a foreign country, they should learn some of the local customs and rituals. Because it is impossible to live completely isolated from foreign people in a foreign country. Outsiders always require assistance and support from natives in order to live successfully in a foreign country. Outsiders, on the other hand, should adopt some of their host country's customs and practices. It is not possible for them to forget their own culture entirely. Celebrating certain festivals in their own country will bring them joy and deep satisfaction. Finally, when people relocate to another country, it is not necessary for them to completely adopt the practices of that country. Outsiders should adopt some aspects of foreign culture while retaining the best aspects of their own culture.",

      "People can choose their lifestyles based on their intentions and aspirations. Rather than settling down in one place, I prefer to travel throughout my life. Moving around primarily stimulates passion and enthusiasm. Instead of a monotonous and unchanging life pattern, I have the freedom to try new things, enjoy new scenery, and meet new people. Everything mentioned above will help to refresh my mind and lift me up. Second, a wealth of experiences shapes a knowledgeable individual. There is no doubt that by traveling to different parts of the world, I have the opportunity to learn about different cultures and customs, such as Thanksgiving Day, Halloween Day, and Thailand's Songkran Festival. In a nutshell, I believe that moving around is an ideal way of life because it adds color to everyday life.",

First and foremost, watching movies makes me feel at ease and relaxed. I'll be amazed as I enter the action worlds of Iron Man and Captain America, but I'll also find solace in the romances of Titanic and Notting Hill. Aside from that, participating in sports, particularly running, teaches me persistence. Running requires me to exert effort in order to reach my destination, which will undoubtedly cultivate self-discipline. As a result, I will not give up easily. In a nutshell, I enjoy watching movies and exercising because they help me become a better person.",

      "If you need to complain about a bad product or poor service, do you prefer to do it in writing, by telephone, or in person (face to face)?",
      "Customers can now complain about a bad product or poor service in writing, over the phone, or in person. Each method has distinct advantages and disadvantages, which allow customers to express their opinions. In my opinion, it is preferable to write about poor products or services. The reason I support this approach is that I easily become angry, and making the right decision is difficult when I am emotionally affected. For example, if I want to express my dissatisfaction, I would rather think about my paragraphs than send a letter or leave negative feedback on websites. Other customers, on the other hand, can read my comment and change their minds, which is extremely beneficial. As a result, by using the writing method, we not only avoid errors but also assist others in selecting appropriate merchandise. So I decided to write to express my displeasure.",

      "It is undeniable that technological progress has brought about unprecedented changes in our human lives over the last century. Some significant inventions in the twentieth century, such as jet planes, television, automobiles, computers, and telephones, fundamentally shaped our modern life. Long-distance travel is becoming more convenient, and increased international communication in many areas such as trade, culture, and technology broadens our activity sphere and broadens our horizons. Medical progress has increased our life expectancy, and some fatal diseases, such as heart disease and breast cancer, can now be cured. Automation's increased productivity in industry and agriculture has ended famine in many regions and dramatically improved our living standards. Even though it has been widely recognized that the benefits produced by technology are not free, I personally believe that technology has made the world a better place, allowing us to enjoy greater material affluence and convenience.",

      "Most people form an opinion and make a comment based solely on the first transaction. However, some people have learned not to rush into decisions about others. And I have personally suffered enormous losses when I relied on my first impressions of people. That is why I choose not to pass judgment too quickly. Some people, for example, have learned not to pass judgment quickly. These people have learned the hard way that if they pass judgment on people too quickly, they will be wrong. They have realized that when a person appears worried and angry at a particular time, they should not rush to judgment because they believe there is something bothering that person and they are unwary. What we need to do, in my opinion, is stop judging people based on their first impressions and think about it more.",

      "If I pursue further education, I would like to major in literature. In the following paragraph, I will elaborate on my specific reasons. Initially, I was not sensitive to numbers. When it comes to calculating numbers, I am always confused and afraid of making mistakes because even a minor mistake can lead to the project failing completely, let alone more complicated equations and formulas. Furthermore, literature appeals to me. I enjoy reading literary works that allow me to experience the thoughts and emotions of others. Reading allows me to learn about events taking place around the world and to draw valuable lessons from them. In short, I would prefer to study literature rather than mathematics.",

      "All students should be required to study art and music in school.",
      "Some people believe that all students should be required to study art and music in school because of the importance of art and music. Others, however, believe otherwise. In my opinion, the former point is more important. I consider this position for the following reasons. The first and most important reason is that art and music can help students learn and concentrate better. As we all know, schools that only teach theoretical courses have a harsh atmosphere, and students are usually uninterested in attending. Art and music classes help to improve this situation and make the school more appealing to students. Another point to consider is that students who study art and music have a better chance of finding work in the future. It is well known that unemployment is a major problem not only in poor countries, but also in developed Western countries. As a result, schools must prepare students and improve their abilities in order for them to have more job opportunities. All of the evidence presented above supports the undeniable fact that teaching art and music in schools improves students' learning performance and increases job opportunities.",

      "Everyone, including myself, has to adapt to new situations throughout his or her life, whether it's starting high school or changing jobs. In the following paragraph, I'd like to share one of my personal experiences. When I first started junior high school, I was completely overwhelmed. Because of my inner shyness, I was afraid of making friends in such an unfamiliar environment with so many students around. Fortunately, my history teacher recognized my issue, organized a class discussion, and encouraged me to express my own ideas. Following his inspiration, I gradually gained the courage to communicate with other students, and they always accompanied me to school. In other words, when confronted with a new situation, we should take steps to advance rather than retreat.",

      "People learn through both personal experience and through the advice of others.",
      "It is undeniable that people progress as a result of their own experiences as well as the advice of others. They unquestionably have advantages and disadvantages. People will have a strong impression of personal experience lessons and will likely never forget them because they witnessed all of the events in person. The disadvantage is that learning progress can be so slow that very little can be gained over a long period of time. Because of the abundant and rich experience of others, the learning performance will be dramatically improved when seeking advice from others. However, due to cognitive differences, it may be difficult and challenging for us to understand the words and behavior of others. Overall, because every coin has two sides, we should combine both benefits while avoiding drawbacks to the greatest extent possible.",

      "Describe some of the ways in which men's and women's roles in the home have changed since your parents' generation.",
      "As society advances, generations can differ from one another. For example, the roles of men and women in the home have shifted dramatically. To be more specific, a man used to specialize in work and be in charge of money earning in the past, whereas a woman was primarily in charge of housework and child rearing. However, the situation is no longer the same as it was previously. Men and women are now equal in both work and family life, which means they both advance their careers and share housework. It is also not surprising that a woman is the breadwinner for the family while a man handles household duties. As a result, with the advancement of society, any pattern of the role that family members play is possible.",

      "Life moves quickly these days, as do our minds, bodies, and everything around us. The reality is that life is extremely short, and we must live and enjoy every moment of it. I prefer to take my time and enjoy life at a more leisurely pace. To begin with, slowing down has advantages in organizing and pre-planning our work for the entire day, which will help us avoid mistakes or forgetting to do the specific work. In addition, life has become more stressful, with constant challenges in all areas. People do not devote enough time to their health. People should slow down their fast-paced lives, take time for exercise and meditation, take vacations and visit new places, and so on. To summarize, life is unpredictable, and we must cherish every moment of it. It's always a good idea to be organized, plan ahead of time, take small steps, and focus on one task at a time. Everyone's health should be their top priority in life.",

To begin, because of advanced technology, mastering computer skills is a must. Students will appreciate the opportunity to operate computers with their own hands in a well-equipped computer lab. They will gradually become proficient in computer systems, which will help them in their future studies and jobs. Furthermore, students can read a large number of books using the internet. As we all know, there is a plethora of study materials and resources available online, so students can reap the benefits of reading books by constructing a computer lab.

      "People are never satisfied with what they have; they always want something more or different.",
      "I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. And without goals, our lives would be less full and exciting. A child, for example, is never satisfied with his toys; he always wants new ones. According to scientists, if a child is given a familiar toy, he will play with it for a short time before forgetting about it. If a child is given a new toy, he will become more enthusiastic and will play with it for two or more days. Our goals shift as we get older and can care for ourselves. First and foremost, we want to be happy and successful, and second, we want our parents to be proud of us. Thus, wanting more or something different is a very natural thing. Without goals, life, in my opinion, is not worth living. If people were content with what they had, we'd probably have to live in caves.",

Being a leader entails dealing with a large number of issues on one's own, so different skills, such as management, execution, and judgment, will undoubtedly be acquired over time. On the other hand, it may put a lot of pressure on you. When leading a team, the director has to cope with difficulties and dilemmas which team members can not handle in a high frequency. This means that the leader must maintain a constant state of anxiety and stress. To recap, due to the two aspects of being a leader, keeping balance is a necessary action.",

It also improves international communication among countries. In my opinion, modern technology is creating a single world culture by bringing people together and making the world smaller. For example, modern technology promotes the globe to frequently use one language. The invention of computers and Internet promotes English to be a global language and dominate in the communication worldwide. Since language is the agent of culture, the worldwide use of English fosters more and more minds thinking alike. Based on the points discussed above, it is obvious that modern technology is creating a single world culture.",
