      "Some say that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.",
      "As the famous old tale saying “Only buy using history as a mirror, can reflect the prosperity and replacement of a country”, this is a very macro perspective in country’s level. As for personal view, learning from history can help summarize the lessons learned, avoid traps and make faster progress. Take mys experience as an example, I was a working rookie one year ago, often making mistakes in my job. But I am good at summarizing experience and forming my own working pattern, so now I am a middle manager in the company and lead a four people team. Why I promote to a higher place in a so short time? It is not only because of I am a good thinker, but also I am very open-minded to learn from my seniors at work which help me stand on the shoulders of the giants. If we want to get a success before we get too old,there is a shortcut:learning from your predecessors,no matter the successful experience and failure lessons, thinking deeply and forming your own particular tackling things methods.",

      "Many people feel compelled to check their cellphones very frequently throughout the day.",
      "It is common to view the habit of constantly checking one's mobile phone as a negative or even obsessive-compulsive behavior. There are several reasons for this. One reason is the proliferation of short video apps, such as TikTok and Instagram, which are designed to be highly engaging and addictive. Many people become dependent on these apps and spend a significant amount of time scrolling through them. Another reason is the reliance on social media for communication and connection. People may spend hours chatting on WhatsApp or other platforms, even when in the presence of friends, in an effort to stay connected and informed. However, this constant need for information and connection can be detrimental, as it can interfere with work and study, leading to a decline in productivity and focus. In the long term, mobile phone obsessive-compulsive disorder can have serious consequences, such as destroying healthy study habits and leading to a sense of aimlessness.",

By finishing a marathon, I would prove to myself that I am capable of pushing through challenges and achieving a goal that once seemed impossible. Moreover, running a marathon is not just about the physical act of running. It requires a lot of mental preparation and focus, as well as dedication and perseverance. These qualities are valuable in all aspects of life, whether it be in personal relationships or professional endeavors.

For starters, young people who have been unemployed for a long time must deal with some psychological issues. They are vulnerable to anxiety, lack of self-confidence, lower achievement motivation, and pessimism, all of which can be barriers to their future success at work and in life. In this situation, young people should actively adjust their hearts and become stronger; at the same time, they should actively reserve knowledge and skills to meet the requirements of the new jobs; and finally, they can lower expectations, not to mention the salary or excessive requirements. Only in this manner will they be able to recover from unemployment.",

Each of us has dreams, no matter how big or small, that require us to work hard to achieve. Difficulties and failures are unavoidable. However, if you think of something positive to keep you in perspective, you will gradually achieve your goal. For example, a year ago, I joined an English speaking club. During the first two months, I couldn't understand what other members were saying, but with my enthusiasm, I continued to visit this club, and my English speaking level gradually improved. Our lives are a competition, and only the most determined individuals can come out on top. We should strive for progress rather than perfection; we should remember what we have accomplished thus far and keep a positive attitude; and when we look back without regret, we are not losers. And at the end of our journey, we will be successful individuals.",

For starters, children become lazy to do anything because he is always in front of the television. They will become sedentary if their favorite program is playing. They become too lazy to do anything, particularly if they have homework. Second, children's behavior can be influenced by television. Most children mimic what they see because they do not understand what constitutes a good or bad attitude. Third, the most dangerous effects are those that are beneficial. Children's eyes become ill as a result of their constant exposure to television. In conclusion, television is not good for almost children’s life.

To begin with, it is widely recognized that the success of any business is dependent on its employees. So, whether or not businesses can provide stable jobs for their employees has a huge impact on everything. Without job security, people would be constantly concerned about their income and quality of life, which would harm their work efficiency.

By visiting these buildings, we can imagine how our forefathers lived and inherited fine qualities. Furthermore, historic structures help the economy by attracting more tourists.

Each has undeniably advantages and disadvantages. For those who are satisfied with their current circumstances, being satisfied means less stress in daily life, which will aid in the development of a peaceful mind. If one remains optimistic in the face of fierce competition, he will be less anxious and stressed. Giving up on progress, on the other hand, will impede performance, resulting in less achievement. Those who are never satisfied have obviously more opportunities to succeed. Because they will take actions to increase their efforts, one of which is a key to success.

Parents must teach their children to distinguish between good and bad programs from an early age. In the long run, children will understand what they should and should not do. Apart from that, parents should keep an eye on their children and, if necessary, talk to them.

As a result, the farming center may happen to discover or invent techniques to solve this problem. Second, an agricultural center is important for education.

      "Our society regards art and science as pillars. An artist and a scientist both play important roles in the development of a civilised society. However, deciding who contributes the most would be difficult; however, in today's world where invention and innovation are buzzwords, I believe a scientist's delivery would be valued more. Scientists are constantly working to improve our quality of life. The scientific revolution is regarded as an epic event that occurred in this century. They assist society in overcoming the obstacles and challenges that their counterparts face through new inventions. Consider computers. Nowadays, people have the ability to do many things more quickly by using computers. An artist provides inspiration and information, whereas a scientist provides innovations and inventions. However, in terms of their contributions to our society, I prefer a scientist over an artist.",

      "Films can tell us a lot about the country where they were made.",
      "Film is a useful tool for providing a scenario of how daily life unfolded for the people of the country where it was made. It embodies the history, culture, and heritage of the country. As a result, films are a reflection of the country. For example, while living in China, I learned a lot about the United States from its movies. For example, I discovered that Americans celebrate holidays such as Halloween and Thanksgiving Day. In addition, while watching Gone with the Wind and Patriot, I learned about many historical events such as the Civil War and the War of Independence. Finally, watching films can teach us a lot about a country because they reflect its life, culture, ethos, history, and so on.",

      "Should gambling be legal?",
      "There is currently debate over whether gambling should be legalized. Gambling, in my opinion, should never be legalized. To begin with, if gambling is legalized, an increasing number of people will abandon hard work in favor of gambling. To be more specific, they do not need to exert effort, such as working from day to night, but can simply harvest money from a game. In the long run, they are not willing to endeavor to work. Secondly, gambling bring unbearable consequences to people. It is common to see a gambler lose all of his fortune even life overnight. To emphasize, gambling ought to be forbidden without any doubt.",

      "In this day and age, illiteracy is considered a curse. This is due to the fact that the ability to read and write is critical in this information age. People must demonstrate this ability in almost every step they take, especially in first-world countries. Literacy, in other words, determines one's current position. In the past, people could live a simple life without an education. As a result, there is no doubt that reading and writing skills are more important today than ever before. Literacy is now the foundation of our daily lives. The majority of jobs necessitate the ability to write and read. The greater a person's ability to read and write, the more successful they will be in their chosen field. As a result, everyone should break the curse of illiteracy.",

      "Nowadays, customers can shop online and write reviews of the products they have purchased.",
      "Shopping online is undoubtedly a popular option for consumers today because it is both convenient and cost-effective. The following paragraph will go over the effects of shopping reviews. For one thing, shopping reviews provide accurate product information. To attract customers, sellers' pictures and descriptions may be falsified. Buyers, on the other hand, will post their true feelings and images online so that we can gain a comprehensive understanding. For another, these reviews can sometimes confuse people. Because different people have different cognitive abilities, a product can be both praised and criticized at the same time. This confusion causes more time to be spent scanning reviews. In conclusion, both positive and negative shopping reviews influence people's purchasing decisions.",

      "Some famous athletes and performers earn millions of dollars per year.",
      "People have spent their leisure time watching sports and other entertainment activities since the beginning of time. Every year, these athletes and performers earn a lot of money. They deserve every penny, in my opinion, because entertainers and athletes put on great shows and make significant sacrifices. Most of these famous people abandon their lives, particularly their childhood. Millions of people aspire to be successful in fields such as entertainment and sports, but only a small percentage of them succeed. Most of them begin training in early childhood in order to be successful, ignoring other aspects of that period such as playing with other children, watching cartoons, televisions, or simply wandering around. Not to mention that they must attend both school and daily training. As a result, they truly deserve to be paid well.",
