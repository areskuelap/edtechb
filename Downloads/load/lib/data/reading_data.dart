      "Many people believe that schools should be banned from serving fast food to their students. Do you agree or disagree? Provide reasons.",
      "I agree that children should be banned from eating fast food at school for two important reasons. First, fast food is detrimental to children's health. For instance, fast food is often packed with fat, sugar, salt, and preservatives which makes them extremely unhealthy for children health. In addition, schools should stop from serving fast food it is very expensive. It is a well-known fact that fresh food from a supermarket is significantly cheaper than pre-made fast food. To conclude, for reasons presented above, I believe it is vital that schools stop serving fast food to their students.",

      "Nowadays, most people agree that the telephone has had a tremendous impact on our lives. First of all, phones have evolved over time, and now almost every person on Earth carries one wherever they go. I still remember when I worked in an office in Osaka and they gave me a company phone. I had to be available all day, everyday. One day I went to the movie theater with my girlfriend at the time and the phone rang right in the middle of the film. I did not want to get fired, so I had to take the call and ruin the movie for everyone in the theater. I felt like a dog on a leash, so I quit. Unfortunately, I have had other jobs where I also had to carry a phone with me at all times. While the car and microwave have impacted our world today, no other invention can quite match the massive effect the telephone has had on our lives.",

      "Over the years, I have attended many classes and had different types of teachers. One teacher who stands out in my mind as the best teacher I have ever had was my high school history teacher. He was extremely compassionate and would hold study sessions before tests to help students who may have been struggling during a unit. His lectures were engaging, and he kept the students gripped with intrigue as he taught. Furthermore, he always made sure that there were hands-on projects to help us further understand the material. I remember one time we were learning about the House of Representatives and the Senate, so he turned the classroom into Congress to help us understand how it worked. I still think about that project every time I hear about politics in America today. He was so dedicated to making sure his students found success.",

      "If my school required me to join a club and I had the option to choose between an athletic club, an academic club, or a volunteer group, I would choose to be part of an athletic club. Being part of a team has many different benefits. First, it would give me the opportunity to be part of a group and learn how to collaborate with others. Second, I think that it is important for people to learn to manage their time and become a member of a team. I remember when I was on the soccer team in high school and all of my teammates expected me to be at every practice and every game. There was no way to skip out with a bunch of phony excuses, I had to show up no matter what, which helped me later in life to balance work and play. Another reason why I would opt for an athletic club is because it would allow me to move my body and keep active so I can maintain a healthy lifestyle. While there may be arguments for each of these options, I think that I would benefit the most from being part of an athletic club.",

More land is required to accommodate houses for the growing population as the world's population is rising. Furthermore, urbanisation is replacing a lot of old buildings. Numerous businesses have been able to annex historic structures in the name of development due to the rapid spread of urbanisation.

I think there is much potential for human civilisation in space research. it is a luxury, though, for a growing nation like ours. Building quality hospitals is one of the key elements to achieving the improved health care systems that our nation so desperately needs.

Furthermore, being exposed to negative experiences in life, having wrong companionship, and low mental health are also causes of problems with student behavior. Most importantly, school authorities aren’t trained enough to handle such student behavior, which in turn exacerbates the issue.",

Furthermore, many historic buildings are being replaced due to urbanisation. The rapid growth in urbanisation has allowed many companies to take over historic buildings in the name of development.
